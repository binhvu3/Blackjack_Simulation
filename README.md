# Decoding the Deck: Leveraging Computer Simulations to Optimize Blackjack Profitability üÉè
Analysis of Blackjack Simulation to determine the optimal play strategies. Contain a written report, code, and data.

## :bar_chart: Result: 
After thousands of rounds and testing various strategies, I found that the best way to beat the game is quit when ahead or never start in the first place. The house always win in the end. The system is design as such. 

## :bookmark_tabs: Abstract
Blackjack is a game card game enjoyed by many throughout the century. Though old, some strategy to
beat the house/dealer have only recently emerged thanks to invents of computer. Blackjack game
methods such as double down and card counting along with statistic are use in combination to
determine the best strategy that would maximize the player‚Äôs profit. Multiples variation of strategies are
simulated, and the average of the return is determined for the most profit.
